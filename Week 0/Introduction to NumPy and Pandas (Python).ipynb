    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of many programming languages. It's popular in part because of its clear, English-like syntax and because of the enormous ecosystem of open source Python tools for almost any aspect of scientific computing.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Guido Van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, originally conceived Python in the late 1980's and released version 1.0 in 1994.\n",
    "It is usually used for:       \n",
    "\n",
    " * web development (server-side),   \n",
    " * software development,   \n",
    " * mathematics,   \n",
    " * system scripting.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to write Python code you'll want a text editor, and to run it you'll need a Python environment. We'll get you up and running with both of these on your local machine later on.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    " * Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).\n",
    " * Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    " * Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    " * Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    " * Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed to for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.   \n",
    "\n",
    " * Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    " * Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.    \n",
    "\n",
    "To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):       \n",
    "\n",
    "`C:\\Users\\Your Name>python --version`\n",
    "<img src=\"CPythonPC.png\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:      \n",
    "\n",
    " `python --version`\n",

    "\n",
    "__1st Method__ \n",
    "\n",
    "If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following [website](https://www.python.org/) \n",
    "\n",
    "__2nd Method__\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Install a modern standard-compliant browser. Either Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome will work well. Try to avoid MS Explorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda:\n",
    "      * Download [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)(a few 100MB), Python 3, 64 bits.\n",
    "      * Install it using the default settings for a single user.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Install modules   \n",
    "\n",
    "When you installed Python 3 you also got pip, the package manager for Python, for free.   \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If that gave you an error you don't have pip installed. Your path and versions may look slightly different. The important thing is that your Python version is at least 3.5. If instead that shows Python 2 then you may have the Python 3 version on your system as pip3.       \n",
    "\n",
    "Try:   \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\"> $ pip3 --version</div>  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If that worked then replace all the examples of pip with pip3 in the coming material.\n",

    "__NumPy__      \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental scientific computing package. Most other Python data science tools are built on top of NumPy and treat it as a dependency. You should be able to install NumPy with:\n",
